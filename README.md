**Deep Reinforcement Learning for SAT solver heuristics**
----
This repository provides three different implementations of Reinforcement Learning techniques for learning SAT (Boolean Satisfybility) solver heuristics.

Included:
  1. Actor Critic algorithm
  2. Experience Replay implementation
  3. REINFORCE algorithm, originally implemented by [@yanneta](https://github.com/yanneta)
